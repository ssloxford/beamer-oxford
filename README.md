# Installing on *nix

Firstly install the font.  You can install it to your user account in
${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local}/share/fonts

To do this, download "Foundry Sterling Book for Windows.zip" from Oxford's [branding toolkit downloads](https://communications.web.ox.ac.uk/branding-toolkit-downloads).

Extract into `~/.local/share/fonts` or equivalent `XDG_DATA_HOME` location.

Run `make example` to compile `example.pdf`.
